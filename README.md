# Bubble-Game

Through this project,I got to know about a new concept in JavaScript which is "Event Bubbling". Event Bubbling is a way of event propagation in the HTML DOM.It relates to the order in which events are propagated. In bubbling, when an event happens, the handler of the innermost element runs, then the parents, and then the further ancestor elements.

In this project,I used:
1. Event Bubbling
2. Event Listeners
3. Functions
